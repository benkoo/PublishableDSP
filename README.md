# PublishableDSP
This Project, Publishing Digital Signal Prcoessing (PDSP) techniques with Jupyter and Mathematica, is an exercise designed to help students work with Notebook-based interfaces to create interactive publications. There are two existing books that this project tries to follow:

The first one is the project by Peter Boardman, Basic Image Processing in Mathematica, which is published in an iBook format. This project includes most of the Notebook content, manually keyed-in again by Ben Koo. And to be refined and translated into other languages.

The second one is Think DSP by Allen Downey, which uses Jupyter Notebook as a interface. We will try to get students to play with the notebooks and DSP examples using Python.

The purpose of this project is to get students to become familiar with Notebook interface and uses Github as a platform to share files and learning experience, comments, etc. Moreover, I wish that by using Github to translate the documents, students learns something about digital publishing tools in the process.
